BITMAKER LABS PREWORK - HTML/CSS RESUME

As instructed by the Bitmaker Labs pre-work, I've created this nifty HTML resume. Worth noting that I relied on my jQuery background to liven it up a bit.

I got a little carried away and created a 'chart' for my various technical skills. The process was educational, as I've never really made anything like it. And while I'm sure there are better ways to achieve the same goal, I'm happy with how mine turned out!
